# Cyclistic-Bike-Share-Data-Analysis

# Introduction

This case study is the Capstone Project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. In this case study, I am a junior data analyst in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a fictitious bike-share company in Chicago.

Cyclistic is a bike-share programme with over 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic distinguishes itself by also providing reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more accessible to people with disabilities and riders who cannot use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders prefer traditional bikes, with approximately 8% opting for assistive options. Cyclists are more likely to ride for pleasure, but about 30% use them to commute to work every day.

Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share programme in 2016. Since then, the programme has grown to a fleet of 5,824 geotracked bicycles that are locked into a network of 692 stations throughout Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked at any time from any station in the system and returned to any other station in the system.

The director of marketing believes that increasing the number of annual memberships is critical to the company's future success. As a result, my team is interested in learning how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. Our team will develop a new marketing strategy based on the findings to convert casual riders into annual members. However, Cyclistic executives must first approve our recommendations, which must be supported by compelling data insights and professional data visualisations.

There are 3 pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as Casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members.

In order to answer the key business questions, I followed the steps of the data analysis process: ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.

# Ask

How do Annual members and Casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

The key stakeholders are:

1. Lily Moreno, the director of marketing and my manager.
2. Cyclistic executive team.

# Prepare

The data I used is Cyclisticâ€™s Historical Trip Data to analyze and identify trends.

The previous 12 months data from 01 April 2022 to 30th March 2023 is used for analysis.

The data is stored in CSV files. Each file contains one month data. Thus a total of 12 .csv files.

The data is structured data ie., Organised data.

The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate.

The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc.

As this data is collected by a real bike sharing company in Chicago, there are no issues with bias or credibility. So its Reliable, Original, Current and Cited (as in ROCCC).

As of data Integrity, its Accurate, Consistent and Trustworthy.

# Key Findings

From the above visuals we can spot some key differences :
1. Users with an annual membership complete more rides than casual riders
2. Among casual riders, Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays are the most popular usage days
3. Docked_bike is the most popular rideable type for both casual and members.
4. The average ride length of casual riders are more than twice as of members.
5. From the average ride length difference, we can conclude that Annual members usually use bike share for daily commuting, while casual riders mostly use bike share for leisure rides mostly during Weekends.
6. The demand on bike sharing service changes significantly around the year. Summers are the most popular, while winters see a more than 50% decrease in demand, most likely due to snowfall in Chicago.

# Recommendation

1. A new Annual Membership package for Weekend usage only will attract current Weekend casual riders.
2. Add more docked bikes to inventory given both casual riders and annual members prefer them over classic and electric bikes
3. Promotions aiming at current Weekday casual riders must be implemented. Those promtions must include the financial savings of taking membership when compared to single passes and full day passes for a year long period.
